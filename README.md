### Question DB

The question database is a file containing a JSON array of questions with the following properties:
```
{
  "answer": "Pizza",
  "category": "FOOD",
  "question": "Crust, sauce, and toppings!",
  "value": "$400"
},
```
Extract the `data/jeopardy_questions.json.gz` and store it in `<hubot_root>/res/questions.json` (Tip: You can also store a minor subset of Qs)
